Hey everyone! Welcome to my AWS ETL Pipeline. This repository holds two different deployment strategies for an ETL pipeline and data processing on AWS. Let dive into it.

## Prerequisites
The following items are prerequisites for this deployment.
<ul>
    <li>TBD</li>
</ul>

## Deployment Overview

### ETL Deployment Strategies
There are two deployment strategies inside this repository. 
<ol>
    <li>Containerized Deployment</li>
    <li>Lambda Deployment</li>
</ol>
These deployment strategies will be broken down below. Details will be shared around their architecture diagram, corresponding Terraform modules and the steps to deploy.

## Container Deployment
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Status</th><th>Deployment Cost</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>WIP</td><td>TBD</td>
    </tr>
</table>
The architecture diagram for this diagram is displayed below:

## Lambda Deployment
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Status</th><th>Deployment Cost</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>WIP</td><td>TBD</td>
    </tr>
</table>
The architecture diagram for this diagram is displayed below:

## Scripts
The following scripts are made for ease of management: reset.sh, vmdeploy.sh, s3deploy.sh, containerdeploy.sh
These scripts will be explained below.

### reset.sh
Resets the environment

### lambdadeploy.sh
